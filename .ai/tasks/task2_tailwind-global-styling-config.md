## Description
Configure Tailwind theme, fonts, color palette, and global styles for luxury/minimalist look. Ensure no border-radius, proper typography, and responsive base.

## Details
- Defined light and dark mode color palettes in `globals.css` using CSS custom properties.
- Configured these colors in Tailwind's `@theme` block.
- Ensured Geist Sans and Geist Mono (from `layout.tsx`) are correctly referenced in the Tailwind theme and applied to the body.
- Implemented a global style `* { border-radius: 0 !important; }` in `globals.css` to enforce no rounded corners.
- Updated body styles for background, text color, and primary font.
- Set up basic structure for typography (headings, paragraphs) for a minimalist aesthetic.

## Test Strategy
- Run `npm run dev` and inspect the application in a browser.
- Verify that the new color palette is applied in both light and dark modes.
- Confirm that Geist Sans is the default font.
- Check that elements do not have rounded corners.
- Ensure basic typography and responsive behavior are as expected.
