## Description
Implement fade-in, parallax, hover, and page transitions using Motion. Set up variants, stagger, and reduced motion support.

## Details
- Create reusable animation variants (fade-in, fade-up, parallax)
- Implement scroll-based and hover/tap animations
- Use AnimatePresence for page transitions
- Add reduced motion support (useReducedMotion)
- Test performance and accessibility of animations

## Test Strategy
- Verify all animation variants work in components
- Test scroll, hover, and page transitions
- Check reduced motion disables/simplifies effects
- Confirm no performance issues on mobile/desktop
