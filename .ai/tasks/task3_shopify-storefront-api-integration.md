## Description
Integrate Shopify Storefront API client, set up env vars, and implement product/collection data fetching utilities.

## Details
- Installed `shopify-buy` SDK.
- Updated `.env.example` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- Instructed user to create and populate `.env.local`.
- Created `src/lib/shopify.ts` with:
  - Shopify client initialization using environment variables.
  - `fetchAllProducts()` function.
  - `fetchProductById(id: string)` function.
  - `fetchAllCollections()` function (fetches collections with their products).
  - `fetchCollectionById(id: string)` function (fetches a collection with its products).
  - Placeholder `fetchProductByHandle(handle: string)` (notes inefficiency with current SDK for this specific operation).
  - Example cart functions for future use.
- Ensured data is serialized to plain objects for Next.js compatibility.

## Test Strategy
- Ensure `.env.local` is correctly populated with Shopify credentials.
- Create a sample Next.js page or API route to test `fetchAllProducts()` and `fetchProductById()`.
- Verify that product data is fetched correctly from the Shopify store.
- Test `fetchAllCollections()` and `fetchCollectionById()` similarly.
- Confirm that errors are handled gracefully if API calls fail or credentials are incorrect.
