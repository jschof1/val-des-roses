some info from her site:
Hello! I’m Iryna, the founder and owner of Vallée des Roses Ltd.
Inspired by architecture, style, versatility, un-usualness, new technologies and the standard of living in London, I always wanted to create something beautiful and charmed like the city where I live. My passion for floristry, beautiful things and interior design has influenced the development of my luxurious floral arrangements, each being the result of the highest quality standards combined with innovative design.

Preserved flowers can stay in our homes all year round, it is so unusual to hear and even more so to imagine. I was fascinated by the idea of ​​building them for our homes - I tested different rosaries in Ecuador until I found one with the perfect quality and composition. Elegant and restrained flower boxes helped me complete my perfect bouquet that will adorn any home design. I want these elegant arrangements to remind you of the care and love someone has for you when they bought a bouquet of our flowers. 

May this gift remain in your hearts forever. 


What are preserved roses?
Preserved roses are real, fresh roses treated with a natural, eco-friendly solution to maintain their beauty and softness for 1–3 years. Unlike dried flowers, they retain their vibrant colors and petal texture without needing water or sunlight. 

How do preserved roses differ from fresh or artificial flowers? 
Fresh roses:

 Last 7–10 days, require water, and wilt. - Artificial roses: Made of plastic/silk, lack natural beauty. 

Preserved roses: 

Real roses that stay fresh for years with minimal care—no watering needed! 

How long do Vallee Des Roses last?
 With proper care, our roses can last 1–3 years. Avoid direct sunlight, humidity, and handling the petals excessively.
