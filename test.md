Key Takeaway
The site is failing to meet the key criteria that every site must achieve:
Clarify your offering at a glance and sell it well with a commonly used structure
Build trust
Drive one clear action throughout the site

1. Clear Messaging
Issue: You land on the hero and feel the luxury, but nothing pushes you to buy. The primary “Shop Eternity Roses” CTA is buried.

2. Trust Signals
Issue: No visible reviews or credibility cues on first views.

3. CTAs That Guide
Issue: “Shop Eternity Roses” sits in the nav; users often ignore nav until later.
My suggestion:
Boost contrast: ivory background, deep rose‑red button.
Rename to “Shop Timeless Roses” for clarity and emotion.
Place this CTA at the end of every major section, plus a sticky footer on mobile.

4. Content Structure & Journey
Issue: After the hero, you get more images but not enough detail or story—no problem/solution flow.
My suggestion: Structure the homepage as a clear journey:
Who You Are – single‑line intro + “Meet the Founder” CTA
What Makes You Speical – “Peak Perfection: hand‑picked blooms…” + “Explore Collection”
Key Benefits – bullets (Lasts 1–3 years, eco‑friendly, bespoke) + CTA
Testimonials – rotating ★ 5 quotes with names & photos + “Read All Reviews”
Product Explorer – filters (size, colour, occasion) + quick‑view grid
Final CTA – banner “Ready for endless blooms?” + “Shop Timeless Roses”
Remember: you can weave in the beautiful images you have thoughtout this. We just want to make sure more of the copy also does the talking. We want to sell the emotional and practical value more.
5. Navigation & Accessibility
Issue: Oversize header, vague labels, potential low contrast on links.
My suggestion:
Slim down the nav: logo left, links centre, a bold “Shop Timeless Roses” button right.
Ensure tap areas are at least 44 px, use WCAG AA contrast for text and buttons.
Make nav sticky on scroll for easy access.

6. Visual Clean‑Up
Issue: Busy layouts, clashing tones, unoptimised images slow loading.
My suggestion:
Limit your palette to 2–3 tones (ivory, deep rose, charcoal).
Introduce 80 px vertical whitespace between sections.
Use next‑gen image formats and lazy‑load off‑screen assets.
Reserve subtle animations (e.g. fade‑in hero text, carousel).

7. Audience Segmentation
Issue: One‑size‑fits‑all messaging doesn’t speak to distinct groups.
My suggestion: Create tailored sections or nav items for:
Home Décor – “Elevate your space with lasting blooms”
Gifting – “Give a year of beauty”
Ethical Luxury – “Sustainably preserved elegance”

Most Critical Fixes
Immediate (3–5):
Swap hero image overlay text for raw text + bold CTA
Add trust‑strip and satisfaction guarantee under hero
Restyle and relocate CTAs for visibility and consistency
Slim and simplify nav, replace the ‘contact us’ button for a ‘shop’ button
Optimise hero assets (modern formats, lazy‑load)
Short‑Term Tweaks (2–3):
Alternate background shades and increase section padding
Standardise button styling and confirm WCAG AA contrast
Long‑Term Strategies (2–3):
Launch a content hub for storytelling and SEO
Develop persona‑driven landing pages (Schools, Gifting, Collectors)
Set up an A/B test roadmap (headlines, CTA text, hero media)

Final Thoughts 
Your preserved roses already captivate with luxury, but the website structure means you’re leaving conversions on the table due to slow load times, generic messaging and a lack of storytelling dilute your premium appeal. You need to sharpen that first‑click experience with clear CTAs and trust signals, speed up images with modern formats, and tailor content to your key segments (home décor, gifting, ethical luxury).
