# Animation System Test Checklist

## Test Strategy Implementation

This document outlines the tests for Task 9: Animations & Framer Motion Patterns

### 1. Animation Variants Test
- [ ] fadeIn animation works correctly
- [ ] fadeInUp animation works correctly  
- [ ] fadeInDown animation works correctly
- [ ] slideInLeft animation works correctly
- [ ] slideInRight animation works correctly
- [ ] scaleIn animation works correctly
- [ ] Staggered animations work with proper timing

### 2. Scroll-based Animations Test
- [ ] AnimatedSection triggers on scroll into view
- [ ] useInView hook works with proper thresholds
- [ ] Animations trigger only once by default
- [ ] Multiple sections animate independently

### 3. Hover and Tap Animations Test
- [ ] AnimatedButton scale variant works on hover
- [ ] AnimatedButton lift variant works on hover
- [ ] Tap/press animations work correctly
- [ ] Button animations respect reduced motion

### 4. Page Transitions Test
- [ ] PageTransition component works with route changes
- [ ] AnimatePresence handles enter/exit properly
- [ ] Loading transitions work correctly

### 5. Text Animations Test
- [ ] AnimatedText basic reveal works
- [ ] Split by words animation works
- [ ] Split by characters animation works
- [ ] Text animations respect timing

### 6. Reduced Motion Support Test
- [ ] useReducedMotion hook detects user preference
- [ ] Animations are disabled when reduced motion is preferred
- [ ] Components still render correctly without animations
- [ ] useAnimationConfig adjusts durations appropriately

### 7. Performance Test
- [ ] No janky animations on scroll
- [ ] Smooth 60fps animations
- [ ] No memory leaks with infinite animations
- [ ] Good performance on mobile devices

### 8. Accessibility Test
- [ ] Animations don't interfere with screen readers
- [ ] Focus states work correctly with animations
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works properly
- [ ] Color contrast maintained during animations

## Test URLs
- Main site: http://localhost:3000
- Animation test page: http://localhost:3000/test-animations
- Individual pages to test: /, /shop, /about

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/test-animations
   - Scroll through the page and verify all animation types work
   - Test hover effects on buttons and interactive elements
   - Check that staggered animations have proper timing

2. **Reduced Motion Testing**
   - Enable "Reduce motion" in system accessibility settings
   - Refresh the test page
   - Verify animations are disabled or simplified
   - Check that content is still accessible

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Monitor frame rate during animations
   - Check for any console errors
   - Test on mobile device if possible

4. **Cross-page Testing**
   - Navigate between different pages
   - Verify page transitions work smoothly
   - Test animations on homepage and other pages
   - Check that animations don't conflict with each other
